      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The University of Michigan School of Information has its own comprehensive online recruiting system 
        <span class="bold">“iTrack,”</span>
        which
        allows students to apply for jobs, research companies, gain industry contacts and manage their job search.

        <br><br>However, as target users ourselves, we had a hard time navigating through iTrack. As students of the
        University of
        Michigan School of Information, we decided to challenge ourselves by redesigning the user experience of
        iTrack's
        landing page.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        We followed the below user-centric design process.
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>1) Analyze the current Information Structure
          <br> 2) User Research & Interview
          <br> 3) User Problem Statement
          <br> 4) Competitive Analysis
          <br> 5) Redesign ideal user flow
          <br> 6) Ideation & wireframing
          <br> 7) Final Design
        </div>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Current Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Information Architecture (IA)</span> is the way of deciding how to organize and structure the contents of the website
        or
        mobile applications. Its goal is to users <span class="bold">find the right information and complete tasks.</span>

        <br><br>The importance of well-designed IA can’t be stressed enough because it <span class="bold">directly impacts the overall
        user experience and
        user satisfaction.</span> To better understand the current IA of ITrack’s landing page, we mapped out their current
        content
        and color coded the related sections.

        <br><br>First, we organized the contents on the landing page into 7 categories:

        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>Landing Page Functions:
          <br><br> 1) Current events
          <br>2) Job search
          <br>3) UMSI announcement
          <br>4) User Profile
          <br>5) Advising scheduling
          <br>6) UMSI resource
          <br>7) Social media integration
        </div>

        <br><br>Then, we narrowed these down to 4 categories.
        <figure>
          <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/IA_colorcode.png" alt="">
        </figure>

        <br>Based on the 4 categories, below is the analysis of current iTrack landing page desktop view.
        <figure>
          <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/current_view.jpg" alt="">

      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Landing Page Perception & User Research</h2>
      <p>
        We asked users to browse through iTrack’s landing page on desktop to understand their pain points and evaluate
        current
        landing page interface.
        <div class="question">
          <br><br>1. What is your first impression of the iTrack’s landing page?
        </div>
        <div class="answer-group">
          <br><span class="red">Unorganized: </span><span class="answer"> “I can’t find what I need. There’s just too
            much going on.”</span>
          <br><span class="red">Bombarded: </span><span class="answer"> “The contents is just all over the place.”</span>
          <br><span class="red">Lack of Focus: </span><span class="answer"> “The main announcement banner is
            overwhelming and I don’t really care.”</span>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <br><br>2. What do you like about the landing page the most?
        </div>
        <br><span class="red">Credibility: </span><span class="answer"> “I like credible resources validated through
          UMSI.”</span>
        <br>

        <div class="question">
          <br><br>3. What do you like about the landing page the least?
        </div>
        <div class="answer-group">
          <br><span class="red">Login process: </span><span class="answer"> “It is a real hassle that it requires me to
            log in every time users click on the website logo."</span>
          <br><span class="red">Redundant information: </span><span class="answer"> “I hate it requires me to log in
            every time clicking on the website logo."</span>
          <br><span class="red">Lack of navigation: </span><span class="answer"> “Too hard to navigate and find
            necessary information."</span>
          <br><span class="red">Lack of importance hierarchy: </span><span class="answer"> “Too many unimportant
            information highlighted."</span>
          <br><span class="red">Account setup process: </span><span class="answer"> “I experienced inconvenient user
            setup process."</span>
        </div>
      </p>

      <section class="process">
        <h2>User Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our previous user research, current iTrack users are having difficulties in:
          <br><br><span class="italic">1. Locating desired information to complete target tasks</span>
          <figure>
            <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/hard_find.png" alt="">
          </figure>

          <br><br><span class="italic">2. Focusing on relevant information in the midst of redundancy</span>
          <figure>
            <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/redundant_info.png" alt="">
          </figure>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="process">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>In order to address such problems, we compared iTrack with top three existing recruiting platforms
          Linkedin, Indeed,
          and Glassdoor.
        </p>
        <figure>

      <section class="process">
        <h2>Ideal User Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Given useful insights from user research, IA and competitive analysis, we sat down re-organizing the “ideal
          user flow”
          of iTrack. We divided the users into four groups with different needs.

          <br><br>Here is an ideal user flow chart we created:

      </section>
      <section class="process">
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          Based on what we had thus far, we brainstormed and started the ideation process. Each of us sketched our own
          solution
          and explained the reasoning behind the designs. After sharing the pros and cons of each design, we then
          combined them
          into a better solution.
        </p>

        </figure>
      </section>
      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        After, we conducted wireframing based on our ideation sprint.
        I used <span class="italic">balsamiq</span> to wireframe in this process.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/itrack_redesign_wireframe.png" alt="">
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>User Feedback & Design Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        After the initial wireframing session, we felt like the information under User Profile section was
        redundant. So,
        we wanted to consolidate some of the features to eliminate redundant information and personalize the User
        Profile
        section.

        <br><br>We conducted a quick user poll with 23 students at the University of Michigan School of Information to
        see
        which design
        users would prefer. Out of 23 students, 16 students indicated they prefer the calendar layout.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="rwd-img" src="itrack_contents/prefer.jpg" alt="">
      </figure>
      <p>
        After gaining user feedback, we decided to add a calendar that visually shows upcoming appointments and
        career-related
        events the user signed up for. Instead of displaying upcoming career-related events on the
        <span class="italic">What’s coming up?</span> 
        section,
        this new calendar allows users to have <span class="bold">a better understanding of what is going on.</span>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Final Design</h2>
      <p>
        After combining user insights on iTrack’s current landing page and new design ideas from ideation session, we
        came up
        with a new landing page for iTrack. This new landing page provides better user experience with its clean look
        and
        well-organized contents.

    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Design Changes and Reasoning</h2>
      <p>
        Followings are some of the reasonings on why we changed the design elements on iTrack’s new landing page.
      
        <br><br><span class="bold">1. Top Navigation bar</span>
        <br><br><span class="italic">Why?</span> 
        <br><br>In iTrack’s current system, the navigation bar on the top never plays its expected role. A random search bar located on
        the top without any explanation leads users to question what to search for. Even though a navigation menu exists on the
        left top corner, it is unclear and redundant in terms of contents organized within each category. This menu only
        confuses the user’s experience on iTrack.
        
        <br><br>We propose a navigation bar with key four features that users could utilize the most : Events, Job Search, UMSI
        Resources, and Profile. Each menu item is clearly distinct and guide the user to easily complete his or her target
        tasks.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">2. User-Centric Profile Section</span>
        <br><br><span class="italic">Why?</span> 
        <br><br>The current user profile on the top right corner of the landing page displays profile image, user name, favorite jobs,
        and followed employees. However, this section doesn’t serves its full purpose as it doesn’t help users to check their
        current application status nor advising sessions.
        
        <br><br>One of the concerns from user interview was that they don’t remember what info session or career events they have
        rsvp’ed to attend. This new user profile allows each user to check their activities and track any upcoming events.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">3. Card Layout</span>
        <br><br><span class="italic">Why?</span> 
        <br><br>Following the user feedback received from interviews, we decided to design a cleaner layout for upcoming events and
        recommended job postings. As Upcoming Events and Job Posts sections are where users are most frequently looking for
        information, we are highlighting these two sections with a more organized layout.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Through this project, I truly realized that 
       <span class="bold">UX design might bring contents to new life.</span> 
       During process, we were surprised that iTrack has its own countless useful information for students.
       However, those contents were buried, hardly being recognized due to lack of user-centric web design.

       <br><br>In this regard, the importance of UX cannot be underestimated at any point.
      This is not only for users, but also for service providers whoever want to maximize
       in utilizing their contents.
