      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In summer 2014, I worked as an UX consultant at Wise-UX Global Consulting Group and worked on the <span class="bold">Samsung
          Global Audio project.</span>
        Samsung brought us one of their core business problems and wanted us to address and solve the issues from UX
        perspectives.

        <br><br>Our global team consisted of eight other consultants including Project Manager, Data Scientist, Business Analyst and UX professionals.
      
      </p>

    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Problem Brief</h2>
      <p>Initial problem that Samsung brought us was:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>"... We ultimately want to make an entry into the high-end & low-end audio market. Therefore, through
          tailored user
          study as well as future trends analysis, we want to get help in making our best business decision before
          jumping into
          the market..."
        </div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>After, we re-defined the problem more specifically, by asking questions like:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br> ㆍ How can we define “high-end” and “low-end” audio market?
          <br> ㆍ What are the products included in “global audio market”?
          <br> ㆍ What are the short-term and long-term business goals?
          <br> ㆍ Are there any specific regions to focus?
        </div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>By digging deeper into questions, we were able to collaborate with the client to clearly define the problem.
      </p>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>My primary roles</h2>
      <p>
        1. Counseled partners in strategy meetings through analysis of market trends and user experience feedbacks,
        highlighting
        potential product development and untapped demand of audio market in the U.S. and U.K.
        <br><br>2. Developed individualized strategy proposals for Samsung Global Audio through creating up-to-date
        databases of
        high-end users, reviewing firm’s marketing process and potential promotion issues in both domestic and global
        markets.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p> We approached the problem by utilizing various framework and methods. Particularly, we spent substantial time
        and
        effort in conducting user study.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Due to confidentiality, I cannot reveal materials I created during the project (references available on request). But as a quick summary
        about
        the process, I was able to experience both <span class="bold">conducting very tailored UX study and business
          strategy/marketing
          analysis</span>. 
          <br><br>It was a valuable experiences for me to spend appreciable energy in <span class="bold">segmenting user types</span>,<span class="bold">conducting trend, industry and competitor analysis</span>,
        <span class="bold">screening and recruiting users</span>
         as well as utilizing diverse <span class="bold"> business strategy</span> methods in the process.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>We successfully concluded the project, and later <span class="bold">this project laid the groundwork for
          Samsung’s M&A (Merger and Acquisition)
          of Harman International Industries, Inc.</span>, one of the biggest audio, electronic, and infotainment
        systems companies
        in the world.

        <br><br>Some of the key features from recently-released Harman audio products, such as smart speaker or new
        premium
        sound bars, were things we included in our final solutions.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Although Samsung has been regarded as one of the most innovative companies in the world, they are having
        somewhat of a hard
        time in applying user-centered business strategy. Through this project, I learned <span class="bold">how to
          incorporate
          both UX process and strategic business analysis into making core business decisions</span>.
        <br><br>As a person who has experienced several business sectors, now I am confident to say that no strategic
        business
        decisions occur without UX feedback. By looking at how Samsung is making a huge growth in the audio industry, I
        also feel
        obliged to become a UX professional who can provide both insightful and strategic guidance to every
        problem-solving task.
