      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p> I joined a three hours deisng jam held by the Library of Great Lake. We as team, were given the topic,<span class="bold">"travel."</span>
      
      <br><br>While conducting extensive user research, I figured that there are abundant needs untapped in travel application, and particularly noticed that many users experience the issues in <span class="bold">finding the most efficient travel routes quickly and conveniently.</span> 
      
            
        <!-- <br><br>I am an enthusiastic traveler, but <span class="bold">making an itinerary takes a lot of time and effort</span>
        even for me.
        Of course, Google Map is my savior in this, but I still often need extra papers to write down notes to
        schedule
        my trip. Whenever my plan undergoes some changes, I go back to the map, search places again, and compare
        distances
        to find the most efficient routes for my entire schedule. -->
        
        <!-- <br><br>While exploring these issues, I came up with the idea of <span class="bold">shopping cart</span>: 
      <br><br><span class="italic">“Why can't we use the concept of shopping cart in helping users to create own routes?”</span> -->

        <br><br>Based on rigorous research with insightful analysis, I finally designed an application, <span class="italic">Route
          Creator.
        </span> The service was <span class="bold">nominated 3rd place</span> in in-house final design
        competition among 23 teams.

    <section class="overview">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Route Creator</span> is an application
        that immediately creates the fastest route based on users' input. Users can add and subtract their wishlisted-places just like a <span class="bold">shopping
          cart</span>.
    
        <br><br> <span class="italic">Why this solution?</span>
        <br><br> <span class="bold">1) Save your time and effort</span>
        <br>Although there have been many travel applications, many users have problems that they still need to spend substantial time and effort to make a solid travel itinerary. 
       <span class="italic">Route Creator</span> would allow users to save their wish-places whenever, and create their unique routes based on users' input immediately. 
        <br><br> <span class="bold">2) Change your plans flexibly and quickly</span>
        <br>From user research, users have problems when they have to spend too much time when changing their travel plans unexpectedly. 
       Through <span class="italic">Route Creator</span>, users can always add or subtract desired places and re-create their own route instantly. 
    
        <br><br> <span class="bold">3) One-stop solution for your travel plan </span>
        <br>From user research, users use average two applications when making travel plans, which is not desirable. <span class="italic">Route Creator</span> not only creates unique routes for users, but also provides essential information regarding their travel plan within the application.


        <br><br> <span class="bold">3) The concept of route (shopping) cart is creative, original and effective. </span>
        <br>From user research, users were very satisfied with the idea of route cart, just like shopping cart. Users can always add and subtract <span class="italic">wishlisted-places into route cart</span> and immediately create their own route quickly and easily.

        <span class="bold">survey</span> and <span class="bold">individual in-depth interviews.</span>
        Before delving into the next phase, I used an <span class="bold">affinity diagram</span> to organize ideas and

      <h2>Impact & Reflection</h2>
      <p>Our team later gathered together and voted for the best design among solutions that each member created. <span class="italic bold">Route Creator</span> received the most responses, and our team made it to 3rd place in in-house design competition among 23 other teams with this application.


        This project gave me three important takeaways.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">One: Although the market is red ocean, opportunities exist.</span>
        <br><br>When I was initially given the project, I was worried that the great number of travel apps available might
        make
        it hard for me to come up with fresh ideas. However, I’ve found that there are always needs untapped, which
        means
        tailored research along with keen insights can always reveal opportunities.
        <br><br> <span class="bold">Two: Feedbacks make everything “so much” better.</span>
        <br><br>From UX research to design, I’ve received tons of feedback not only from users but also other designers
        or
        project managers. Users’ feedbacks are the core part of everything, helping me to fully empathize with their
        need
        so that I don't over-rely on my personal opinions. Other designers’ feedback allowed me to further consider
        details
        of my design based on professional UX and aesthetic views. Project managers’ feedback allowed me to consider
        the
        business value of my product.
        <br><br> <span class="bold">Three: Great ideas are always coming from team discussions.</span>
        <br><br>In this team setting, I truly enjoyed our team discussion and ideation sprint sessions. There were always great ideas coming from our team discussions and I realized the importance of being open to others views and ideas and embracing diversity. There are always great advantages of working together.
