      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p> 
      As one of the most reputable medical institutions both inside and outside of the United States, Michigan medicine has constantly made substantial efforts to provide excellent patient care. As a part of its efforts, Michigan Medicine has provided interpreter services since before 1990 and currently has between 370 to over 2,000 request per month. However, <span class="bold">the client is currently having difficulty in scheduling interpreters with patients
      due to lack of an efficient booking system.</span>
      
      <br><Br>Through this course project, the client is looking for a better way to staff interpreters, and ideally seeks for staffing people on-demand. Our team, ACT*M, primarily utilized qualitative UX research methods trying to deliever the best solutions to our client.
      </p>
    </section>
 
    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Background Research</h2>
      <p> After our initial meeting, we conducted individual background research to better understand our client and medical interpreter service and staffing business as a whole. 
    
        <br><br><span class="italic">There were three foci of my research:</span>
        <br><br><span class="bold">
        1) What is Michigan Medicine Interpreter Service and what are its core missions and target populations?
        </span>
        <br><br><span class="bold">
        2) What are the significances of medical interpreter service and why is ideal staffing in interpreter services
        important to patients, service providers, and the client?
        </span>
        <br><br><span class="bold">
        3) How is the leading institution providing efficient medical interpreter staffing service, and what are the key
        takeaways in regard to the client’s current problems?

    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Contextual Inquiry and Interviews</h2>
      <p> We conducted contextual inquiry and structured individual interviews. We conducted five interviews in total with interpreter service schedulers, interpreter supervisor, and interpreters. Each interview took an hour and we made annotated notes for every interview.
      
      <br><br>The key takeaway here was being able to better understand and empathize with interviewees as we were in their working context together. Before each meeting, we created comprehensive interview protocols asking tailored questions for each interviewees. While conducting interviews, we were sitting next to interviewees, observing every detail to gain better insights.

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Interpretation & Affinity Wall</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted interpretation sessions for every interview. During these sessions, each team member walked through their annotated notes with other members in details so we could synthesize all data, findings and insights together.
        <br><br> Based on our interpretation sessions, we created extensive affinity diagram. We met every week spending about four to six hours to categorize interview contents, quotes, and other contextual information. Going through iterative grouping affinity notes process allowed us to discover underlying problems of our client, which
        later became the foundations of our recommendations.

      <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        Through the rigorous UX study conducted over the past four months, our team finally delivered our report to the client.
        Key findings and recommendation summary is as follows:
        <br><br>
        <span class="bold">Alternative Interpretation Methods:</span>
        <br>
        While in-person interpretation services are often preferred by providers and interpreters, with over 2,000 requests per
        month and limited resources, it is impossible to provide an interpreter for each patient appointment at Michigan
        Medicine. As a result, alternative interpretation methods, such as remote telephonic or video interpreting must be
        explored.
        
        <br><br>
        <span class="bold">LEP Patient Focus:</span>
        <br>
        While Interpreter Services exemplifies patient-focused values for LEP patients, training issues and other problems with clinics and hospitals makes it appear as if others in the health system are unaware of how to best care for LEP patients. As a result, the issue from lack of awareness of the importance of LEP patient’s care from all related parties should be addressed in a timely manner.
        
        <br><br>
        <span class="bold">The MiChart System:</span>
        <br>
        We found that inefficiencies in the Michart system often leads to overbooking or underbooking, leading to overall
        inefficient staffing of interpreters as one of the root causes of Interpreter Services’ staffing problems. Because
        Interpreter Services is able to make requests to MiChart for overall system changes, we identified multiple places for improvement and suggested recommendations in the current MiChart system.
